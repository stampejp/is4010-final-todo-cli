# AI Tools Used

## Tools
- GitHub Copilot — in-editor suggestions and boilerplate
- ChatGPT — design help, test examples, and debugging assistance

## Example prompts
- "Design a CLI todo app in Python with add, list, done commands"
- "How to write pytest tests for click-based CLI using CliRunner?"
- "Generate a GitHub Actions workflow to run pytest on Python 3.10"

## Reflection
I used AI to accelerate boilerplate creation and to suggest test cases. Every AI suggestion was reviewed and tested manually before being incorporated.
